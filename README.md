During this UTA11 study, we used several repositories to store the source code of our prototypes, later tested as *proof-of-concepts* under this research work.

TODO: put links prototypes!

We deployed each prototype in a remote server. You can find the [deployed prototypes](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/Technical.md#deployment-prototypes) on the [`Technical.md`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/Technical.md#deployment-prototypes) file of the [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository. Unfortunately, you need to be a member of our team to access the restricted information.
