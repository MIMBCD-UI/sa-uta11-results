TODO

During this UTA11 study, we used several repositories to store the source code of our prototypes, later tested as *proof-of-concepts* under this research work. The prototypes are available in the [`prototype-assertive-proactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-assertive-proactive), [`prototype-assertive-reactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-assertive-reactive), [`prototype-non-assertive-proactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-non-assertive-proactive), and [`prototype-non-assertive-reactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-non-assertive-reactive) repositories. We deployed each prototype in a remote server. On the same hand, the hereby *results* represent the pieces of information of both [BreastScreening](https://BreastScreening.github.io) and [MIDA](https://mida-project.github.io) projects. These projects are research projects that deal with the use of a recently proposed technique in literature: [Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). From a developed User Interface (UI) and *framework*, these deep networks will incorporate [several datasets](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/Datasets) in different modes. You can find the [deployed prototypes](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/Technical.md#deployment-prototypes) on the [`Technical.md`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/Technical.md#deployment-prototypes) file of the [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository. More information about the study is also available on the [`User-Research.md`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/User-Research.md#test-11-assertive-and-non-assertive-introduction-) file of this [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository. Unfortunately, you need to be a member of our team to access the restricted information. We also have several demos to see in our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPz4aTIVHekHXTxHTUOLmXw), please follow us.

abstract = {Intelligent agents are showing increasing promise for clinical decision-making in a variety of healthcare settings. While a substantial body of work has contributed to the best strategies to convey these agents’ decisions to clinicians, few have considered the impact of personalizing and customizing these communications on the clinicians’ performance and receptiveness. This raises the question of how intelligent agents should adapt their tone in accordance with their target audience. We designed two approaches to communicate the decisions of an intelligent agent for breast cancer diagnosis with different tones: a suggestive (non-assertive) tone and an imposing (assertive) one. We used an intelligent agent to inform about: (1) number of detected findings; (2) cancer severity on each breast and per medical imaging modality; (3) visual scale representing severity estimates; (4) the sensitivity and specificity of the agent; and (5) clinical arguments of the patient, such as pathological co-variables. Our results demonstrate that assertiveness plays an important role in how this communication is perceived and its benefits. We show that personalizing assertiveness according to the professional experience of each clinician can reduce medical errors and increase satisfaction, bringing a novel perspective to the design of adaptive communication between intelligent agents and clinicians.},
