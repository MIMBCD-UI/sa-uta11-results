TODO

During this UTA11 study, we used several repositories to store the source code of our prototypes, later tested as *proof-of-concepts* under this research work. The prototypes are available in the [`prototype-assertive-proactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-assertive-proactive), [`prototype-assertive-reactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-assertive-reactive), [`prototype-non-assertive-proactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-non-assertive-proactive), and [`prototype-non-assertive-reactive`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-non-assertive-reactive) repositories. We deployed each prototype in a remote server. You can find the [deployed prototypes](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/Technical.md#deployment-prototypes) on the [`Technical.md`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/Technical.md#deployment-prototypes) file of the [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository. More information about the study is also available on the [`User-Research.md`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/User-Research.md#test-11-assertive-and-non-assertive-introduction-) file of this [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository. Unfortunately, you need to be a member of our team to access the restricted information.
